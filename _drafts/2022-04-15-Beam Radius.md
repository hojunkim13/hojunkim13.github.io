# Liu's method (or D<sup>2</sup> method)

A gaussian laser beam profile is expressed mathematically as,

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(r) = F_0{\cdot{}}e^{-2r^2/w^{2}_{0}}
\end{aligned}
\tag{1}
$$

where $F(r)$ is the local fluence at a given radial position, $r$, $F_0$ the peak fluence value and $w_0$ the radial Gaussian beam waist at $1/e^2$ the peak value. Liu's method, under the hypothesis of a deterministic ablation behaviour, defines the ablation fluence threshold, $F_{th}$, as the local fluence corresponding to the border of the crater, exhibiting a radius equal to $R$. Therefore, the following expression is obtained,

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{th} = F_0{\cdot{}}e^{-2R^2/w^{2}_{0}}
\end{aligned}
\tag{1}
$$
